<p> Since I know what I wanted to do in my future, I always dreamed to study Computer Science and Software Engineering. Therefore, at college I had studied Information Technology. As an IT student, I had some coding skills while studying at college, such as, I have learned CSS coding, because I have created my own E-commerce website using CSS coding on Adobe Dreamweaver. Therefore, after I complete the website, extending my knowledge in coding was one of my hobbies, since I always wanted to learn coding. This is because I would like to create my own website, since I am a content creator, so that, my website will help me to reach my audiences, and promote the products thsoe I would like my fans to buy from me. After I finish my education, I would like to do my own business, therefore, I think knowing the coding will allow me to do the business that I want to do in future. </p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Generative Ball Art</h3>
    <p>
    The first programming project that I have done at City University, concluding the 2 weeks of Programming Bootcamp 2021.
	This Processing project that I have created demonstrates the understanding 
	of the use of variable x position, using randomness for selecting the random colours in the specific balls and changing the colour while the balls rotates, using rotatiting with radians, PushMatrix and PopMatrix, KeyPressed, using the translate, and the framerate to control the speed of the rotation of the balls. I created the generative ball art in which 
	the balls rotates and enlarges, when the mouse is positioned to X position. In addition the balls change the colour while rotation and when the mouseX is pressed and at the same time it increases the numbers of the balls appeared on the screen.
